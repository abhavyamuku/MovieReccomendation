# Movie-Recco-System
The Movie Recommendation System is a machine learning–based web application designed to help users discover movies they are most likely to enjoy. By analyzing movie data and user preferences, the system intelligently suggests films that are similar to the one selected by the user.

The system is built using Python, Flask, and machine learning techniques like cosine similarity and feature extraction. It processes data from the TMDB 5000 dataset, combining features like genre, cast, director, keywords, and description to identify the most relevant recommendations.

Users interact with a clean, responsive web interface where they can select a movie title from a dropdown menu and instantly receive personalized movie suggestions — just like Netflix or IMDb.

✅ Key Features:
Input: User selects a movie from the dropdown

Output: System recommends top 5 similar movies

Backend: Python + Flask
